# Division Calculator (Calcdivi)

## Description

The `Calcdivi` Java project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to perform division calculations. The application takes two integer inputs and computes the result, displaying an error message if division by zero is attempted.

## Features

- Simple division calculation
- User-friendly GUI
- Error handling for invalid and zero inputs
- Visual feedback with a custom icon and background image
## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## How It Works
The user inputs two numbers into text fields.
Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the result is displayed or an error message is shown if invalid or zero input is encountered.

## Code Overview
The Calcdivi class extends JFrame and contains a GUI with components for user input, calculation, and result display. The placeComponents method sets up the GUI layout with labels, text fields, buttons, and event handling for division calculations.

## Acknowledgments
- Custom icon and background image used in the GUI.
- Java Swing for creating the GUI components.
